Hi, I'm David.  I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer and have been developing software professionally since the 1990's.

I first got interested in computing with a ZX81 learning BASIC programming. Since then, I've programmed in many languages that usually involve semi-colons, but also in Python :)

I'm a proponent of testing and quality code, and have written [several books](https://www.packtpub.com/authors/david-salter).
